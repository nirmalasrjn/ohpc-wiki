As of May 2016, the OpenHPC project is operating as a [Collaborative Project](http://collabprojects.linuxfoundation.org) through the [Linux Foundation](http://www.linuxfoundation.org). Overall OpenHPC governance is led by two primary entities outlined as follows:

1. **Governing Board:** general responsibilities include budgetary approval and the management of all non-technical business and outreach/communication.
2. **Technical Steering Committee (TSC)**: general responsibilities include coordination and management of all technical matters for the project, including release management, component selections, and technical community engagement.

The TSC includes a variety of roles intended to help organize the work effort and to include representation from development groups and end users.  A graphical overview of the current roles that comprise the TSC is highlighted below.
