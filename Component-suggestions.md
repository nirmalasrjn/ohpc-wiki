This is a list of component suggestions for potential inclusion into future versions of OpenHPC. Note that being listed here does not guarantee inclusion as a more formal selection and review process is likely to be instituted by a technical steering committee once the governance process is formalized. However, it is intended to provide an initial centralizing location to log suggestions.
